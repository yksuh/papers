We propose a novel structural causal model to explain the origins of DBMS thrashing.
We present a space of hypotheses that can refine and support the proposed model.
We extend a recent DBMS-centric research infrastructure for thrashing experiments.
We propose a novel analysis protocol that can be applied to obtained thrashing data.
We suggest engineering implications to researchers and DBAs for better performance.
