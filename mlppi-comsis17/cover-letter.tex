\opening{Dear Prof. Vladimir Kurbalija (or Editor-in-Chief):} 
 
\noindent An earlier version of this submission was published in Proceedings of the 21st ACM \hbox{International} Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM). 
This version to be submitted to Computer Science and Information Systems includes the following substantial extensions.

\begin{itemize}

\item Expanded Algorithms: we expand the description of the pre-processing, initial and optimized phase algorithms shortened in the earlier version. Furthermore, this submission contains three additional algorithms as follows:

\begin{itemize}

\item splitting overlapping ranges in Algorithm~2 on page~4,
\item checking the allowed field count limit on the split ranges on in Section 2.1.4 on page~5,
\item computing scan cost in Algorithm~3 on page~6, and
\item computing query cost in Algorithm~5 on page~7.

\end{itemize} 
 
\item Complexity Analysis: we conduct the asymptotic running time analysis on each phase in Section 3 on page 8.

\item Experiments: we provide additional runtime statistics on the workloads used in the experiments in Table 1 on page 10. 
In addition, we compare the quality of a human expert's recommendation with that of our wizard in Figure 5 on page 10.

\item Expanded Literature Review: the related work section on page~9 elaborates in detail on the similarities and differences between our wizard and existing tools.

\end{itemize} 
 
\closing{Sincerely yours,} 

\end{letter}
