\opening{Dear Prof. Rajkumar Buyya:} 
 
\noindent 

Attached is a minor revision that responds to the first reviewer's comments. 
We marked in red some text in response to his/her comments. 
The revision also includes some texts marked in blue that are added or updated. 
Note also that we replaced the term of {\em PUT} with another term, called {\em INC}, 
in order to prevent readers from getting confused with a general concept of the program under test. 
Many thanks to you for taking sincere care of our manuscript during a series of reviews.

\closing{Sincerely yours,} 

\end{letter}
