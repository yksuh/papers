\opening{Dear Editor-in-Chief:} 
 
\noindent 

I am re-submitting a revised manuscript that responds to a previous reviewer's comments. 
I mark in red some text in response to the reviewer's comments. 
This revision also includes some text marked in blue that are added or updated, 
compared to its previous version.

Here are highlights of differences between the revision and the previous version.

\begin{itemize}

\item Research goal: the goal of this manuscript is clearly stated upfront in Section~1. 

\item Characteristics: the distinctions of our protocol are discussed 
in the paragraph of ``Characteristics" in Section~1. 

\item Timing environment: the description of our timing environment 
is moved upfront to Section~1 (from Section~2), 
to emphasize the fact that even though a timing environment was well configured, 
there still existed significant variability in the traditional measurement method.

\item Terminology: the definition of ``dual-PUT" is provided with its example in Section~2. 

\item Experiments: the results from a new experiment are provided in Fig.~5 on page~4.

\end{itemize} 

Many thanks to you for handling our manuscript.

\closing{Sincerely yours,} 

\end{letter}
